# comptime-nn
- a gradient engine to differentiate multivariable expressions at compile time
- a neural network library with topology specified at compile time, and all gradient functions calculated  

Inspired by micrograd, but seeking performance improvements via compiler optimization compared to the traditional runtime tree.
